<p>Hello! I'm Trent and I'm a junior front end developer familiar with WordPress, HTML5, CSS and Javascript. I take existing designs and turn them into functional HTML & CSS static sites, or modify the appearance of a PHP 
framework like WordPress to achieve design goals. I am also no stranger to back end development, and have enough understanding of PHP systems to delve into the inner workings of a site to diagnose problems.</p>

<p>You can view some of my previous work <a href="{{ site.github.url }}/portfolio">here</a>, and contact me <a href="{{ site.github.url }}/contact">here</a>.
